# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help out! Here's how:

## Reporting Bugs

Found something broken? Open an issue and include:
- What you were trying to do
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce it
- Your Android version and device model
- Screenshots if it's a UI bug

## Suggesting Features

Got an idea? Cool! Open an issue first so we can discuss whether it makes sense and how to implement it.

## Submitting Code

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fix-something`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test it on a real device if possible
5. Commit with a simple message (`git commit -m "fixed subtitle sync issue"`)
6. Push and open a PR

## Code Style

Just follow what's already there. Keep it readable and don't overcomplicate things.

## Testing

- Test on different Android versions if you can (at least API 24+)
- Check both portrait and landscape modes
- Make sure gesture controls don't break player controls
- Test with different video sources

## What Needs Help

- Better subtitle sync detection
- Support for more subtitle formats
- Performance optimization
- UI improvements
- Bug fixes

## Questions?

Just open an issue if you're not sure about something.

Thanks!
