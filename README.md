## What is this?

A streaming app I built while learning Android development. Features a custom video player with gesture controls and automatic subtitle discovery.

## Features

- Black and purple theme
- Custom video player with ExoPlayer
- Gesture controls (double-tap to seek, long-press for 2x speed)
- Automatic subtitle discovery and parsing
- Quality selection
- Rotation lock

## Installation

Download the APK from releases or build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Puneeth-R-140/pocket-nexus-streaming.git
cd pocket-nexus-streaming
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Tech Stack

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- ExoPlayer
- Hilt for DI
- Retrofit for networking
- Room for local storage
